        <p>The indian haka noodles is known for its spicy exotic taste, by combining the sweetness of the corn and the spices,
            making it a delicious feast that can be prepared on a short span of time.<br>
            Best part about this is the visual appeal. Tossing food in a hot wok brings up the taste in anticipation. 
            Reminds me of all those street food thellas back home in India. They make it day in and out. 
            Indian street food has everything in it from bhelpuri to an Indo Chinese dish like fried rice and Manchurians . 
            These days you even get Chinese bhel inspired by Asian flavors. 
            You can find them in any city. Most of the youth thronging to this street food centers for a quick bite.
